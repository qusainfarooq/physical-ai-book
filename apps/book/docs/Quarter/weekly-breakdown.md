# Weekly Breakdown
Here’s the rough plan for the quarter:
- Weeks 1–2: Figuring out what Physical AI even is
- Weeks 3–5: Diving into ROS 2 (expect some debugging pain here)
- Weeks 6–7: Playing with Gazebo simulations
- Weeks 8–10: NVIDIA Isaac — powerful but takes patience
- Weeks 11–12: Humanoid robot development (the fun part)
- Week 13: Conversational robotics and wrapping it all up
