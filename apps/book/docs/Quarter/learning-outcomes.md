# Learning Outcomes
By the time we’re done, you should be able to:
- Explain what “Physical AI” means without sounding lost
- Use ROS 2 to make robots do basic tasks
- Run simulations in Gazebo and Unity (where robots can crash safely)
- Build perception pipelines with NVIDIA Isaac
- Experiment with humanoid robots and see how they interact
- Hook up GPT models so robots can actually hold conversations
