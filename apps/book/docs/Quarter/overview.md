# Quarter Overview
This quarter is all about connecting AI brains to physical or simulated bodies.  
Think of it as giving robots a mind and then watching how they behave in the real world (or at least in a simulator). We’ll be bouncing between tools like ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, and NVIDIA Isaac. By the end, you’ll see how language models can actually control robots in a way that feels natural.
